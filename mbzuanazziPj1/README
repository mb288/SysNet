TCP Server

PLEASE READ PROJECT1OBSERVATIONS.doc

Overview:
The TCP Server project demonstrates the implementation of a simple HTTP server using TCP sockets in C++. The server listens on a specified port and responds to HTTP requests from clients. It serves HTML files and handles GET requests by sending appropriate responses.

Requirements:
C++ compiler (supporting C++11 standard)
Operating System: Linux/Unix (for POSIX socket API)

Usage:
Compile the server program using the provided Makefile:
            make
Run the server executable:
        ./tcp_server

This starts the server, and it will begin listening for incoming connections on port 60001 by default.

Access the server from a web browser:
Open a web browser and navigate to 'http://localhost:60001/index.html' .
The server will respond with a basic HTML page displaying a welcome message.

Files:
tcp_server.hpp: Header file containing the TCPServer class declaration.
tcp_server.cpp: Source file containing the implementation of the TCPServer class.
main.cpp: Source file containing the main function to run the server.
index.html: Sample HTML file served by the server.
makefile: Makefile for compiling the project.
